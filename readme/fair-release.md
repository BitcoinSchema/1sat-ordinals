# Fair Launch

## Genesis Coinbase

Inscription numbers will begin 218 blocks after a block is mined with a specific coinbase string.

The coinbase string that begins the countdown will be:

```
1SAT ORDINALS IN 218 BLOCKS - docs.1satordinals.com
```

When 218 blocks have been mined after this block, The inscriptions inside the 121st subsequent block, not including the block with the coinbase string, will contain the first numbered inscriptions, starting from 0.

## First Block

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
The first block has not been mined yet.
Watch the blockchain for the 1sat genesis coinbase string.
```
{% endcode %}
