# Fair Release

It is our intention to launch the protocol and provide a window of opportunity for minters looking secure early inscription numbers. Inscription numbers will begin 121 blocks after a block is mined with a specific coinbase string.

The coinbase string that begins the countdown will be:

```
THE 1SAT ORDINALS PROTOCOL BEGINS IN 121 BLOCKS
```

When 121 blocks have been mined after this block, the ordinals inside of it will contain the first inscriptions, starting from 0.

## First Block

```
The first block has not been mined yet
```
